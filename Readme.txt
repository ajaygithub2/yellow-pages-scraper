Install these libraries:

1. Pandas : pip install pandas OR 
            conda install pandas

2. Pdfkit : pip install pdfkit OR
            conda install -c conda-forge python-pdfkit

3. BeautifulSoup : pip install bs4 OR
                   conda install -c conda-forge bs4

4. Requests : python -m pip install requests OR
              conda install -c anaconda requests


Note: If you want your output in a pdf file, you will have to install an additional library called 'wkhtmltopdf',
      if not, then there is no need to install it.

Run the script and enjoy. Thankyou.
